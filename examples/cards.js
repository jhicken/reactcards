## Counter

This is a stateful counter. If you change the value prop
in the source file it will not update because the new prop will be ignored
and instead the component local state is rendered.

Implement *componentWillReceiveProps* and override the component local state
if you want this to work as expected.

## Stateless Counter
This example shows how to manage state when you have a stateless
component. The card can also dump the current state as JSON if
you set the *inspect* flag to true.
